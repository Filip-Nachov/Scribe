Here will be shown the basic file operations, movement, writing (insert mode) 

### file operations
To open Scribe use:
```bash
scribe
```
To open a file using Scribe:
```bash
scribe filename.ext
```

To quit without saving use Ctrl-Q and to save use Ctrl-S (if saving for the first time you will have to type in a name) to Search trought the file use "/" (if there are multiple results you can move around them with arrow up and arrow down)
### Movement
To move around in it use h, j, k, l
or arrow keys if you prefer them. To move at the begining of a word use A or Home Key and for the End of the word use D or END key. To move at the end of a screen use M or PAGE_DOWN and PAGE UP or N to move at the begining of the screen!

### Writing
To write like in many other text editors you have to use i to go to insert mode and type while in there you can move around with the arrow keys and click escape to quit aka go back to normal mode. The file operations dont work while in insert mode
